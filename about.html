        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Introduction</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">I am Rachel Atmadja, a Strategic Design Lead who is working towards equitable human outcomes in the design of AI-powered experiences and products.</h3>

        <p>I lead the Strategic Design of Human-Centered Service and Product Experiences. I have held the role of Design Lead within the Innovation and Ventures arm of two Fortune-ranked companies. My recent achievements include leading the research & design for an internal startup to secure funding and save the project, and facilitating alignment of cross-functional stakeholders around a future-state end-to-end vision for the highest-grossing line of business of the company.</p>

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What is your design approach?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">I measure the quality of a design by its ability to move people closer towards achieving their goal, or life purpose.</h3>

        <p>I adopt an empathetic posture to innovation that is rooted in a deep understanding of the lived experiences of the people that we are designing for. My deep vertical skills are in the areas of customer insight synthesis, customer narrative storytelling, strategy, multichannel service experience design, and digital platform design. My horizontal collaborative skills are in empowering design and delivery teams with visual frameworks, aligning cross-functional partners to elevate their vision, leading disruptive service & product design, facilitation, and project management. </p>

        <p>Formerly an Architectural Designer, I received my <a href="studioArch.html" class="link-work" target="_blank">design education</a> from the College of Architecture & Environmental Design at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I practiced architecture professionally for six years, the Santa Monica firm <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="https://www.kearch.com/">Koning Eizenberg Architecture</a> is the last architecture design firm that I had the honor to join. Today, I design digital experiences and services that are built for impact at a scale that I can only dream of. It turns out I never really stopped building things after all.</p>

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What motivates you?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">A large part of my work is having the ability to discern where people are struggling, and where people are being excluded from opportunities for a better way to live, work, and play.</h3>
        <p>Envisioning a future where inclusion becomes a primary guiding principle in the allocation of opportunities and resources in society genuinely moves me to do my best work. By upleveling to the human lived experience, I make sense of the complexity of human interactions and bring clarity to the ambiguous space that is innovation.</p>

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What are your interests outside of work?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">I am an avid reader and writer. I also like to build things with my hands.</h3>
        <p>I <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="writing.html">write about design, technology, & ethics</a>. My curiosity about the role of design in the creation of AI-powered smart services led me to synthesize a framework to <a target="_blank" class="link-ref" href="casestudy-MomentMap.html">design for unpredictability in the human experience.</a></p>
        <p>I design and craft <a href="studioFurn.html" class="link-work" target="_blank">furniture</a> inspired by architectural hardware pieces and other objects of industry. To put my <a href="studioFloristry.html" class="link-work" target="_blank" >floral design</a> skills to good use, I arrange floral bouquets for friends and family on special occassions.</p>


        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Which buildings did you work on?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">I am fortunate to have worked on a skyscraper, a stadium, and several urban housing projects within the first few years of my architectural career.</h3>
